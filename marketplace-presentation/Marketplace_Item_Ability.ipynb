You only care if the photo looks professional and distraction-free. Instructions: Analyze the composition and background of the image using the following strict checklist. Fail Criteria (Output Fail_Presentation if ANY are true): 1. A person is wearing the item (model or selfie), or body parts (hands, feet, legs) are visible in the frame. 2. The image shows a pile of clothes, a \"lot\" of multiple items, or other garments are visible nearby (e.g., a closet floor). There must be only ONE item. 3. The background is cluttered with non-clothing objects (trash, power cords, furniture legs, unmade rumpled bedding, dirty laundry). 4.  The item is on a \"loud\" or busy patterned surface (e.g., complex oriental rug, multicolor quilt) that makes the item hard to focus on. 5. The item is the same color as the background (e.g., a black shirt on a black bedspread), causing the edges to disappear. 6. The item is draped over a chair, door handle, or balled up on a messy floor instead of being laid flat or hung neatly. Pass Criteria (Output Pass_Presentation if true): The item is the clear, singular focus. The background is relatively plain, clean, and contrasts enough with the item to show its shape. The item is laid flat centered in the image or hung on a hanger. Output: Return exactly one label: Pass_Presentation or Fail_Presentation\",\n",
